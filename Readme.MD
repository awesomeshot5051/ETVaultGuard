# Releases for ETVaultGuard

## Changelog

### ETVaultGuard v8.0 - The Cross-Platform Update

* **Smart Drag & Drop:**
  * *Linux:* Full drag-and-drop support for encryption.
  * *Windows:* Implemented intelligent fallback logic to bypass Administrator security restrictions (UIPI).
* **Recursive Encryption:** Added support for encrypting entire folder hierarchies.
* **Auto-Timeout Security:** Implemented a global idle timer.
* **Secure Wipe:** Integrated "White-Stripe" deletion technology.

#### UI & UX Improvements
* **Universal Dark Theme:** A complete visual overhaul ensures a consistent theme across all screens.
* **Theme Consistency:** Fixed visual glitches on initial vault access.

#### Backend & Core Systems

Releases for ETVaultGuard
# Changelog
ETVaultGuard v8.0 - The Cross-Platform Update
  This major update marks the transition of ETVaultGuard from a Windows-centric tool to a robust, cross-platform security suite. Version 8.0 introduces full Linux support, direct file creation, and intelligent UI adaptations, alongside significant security enhancements.
  
  New Features
  Cross-Platform Support: Full compatibility with both Windows and Linux. The application now intelligently detects the operating system to handle file systems and permissions correctly.
  
  Direct File Creation: Users can now create, edit, and encrypt files (e.g., .txt, .docx, .code) directly within the vault, removing the need to create files externally and import them later.
  
  Smart Drag & Drop:
  
  Linux: Full drag-and-drop support for encryption.
  
  Windows: Implemented intelligent fallback logic to bypass Administrator security restrictions (UIPI), ensuring a smooth workflow without crashes.
  
  Recursive Encryption: Added support for encrypting entire folder hierarchies at once, preserving the directory structure inside the vault.
  
  Auto-Timeout Security: Implemented a global idle timer that automatically secures the vault after a set period of inactivity, even when external viewers are open.
  
  Secure Wipe: Integrated "White-Stripe" deletion technology to securely overwrite and sanitize temporary files during cleanup.
  
  UI & UX Improvements
  Universal Dark Theme: A complete visual overhaul ensures a consistent, professional dark theme across all screens (Vault, Login, Settings, and Editors).
  
  Theme Consistency: Fixed visual glitches where the theme would not apply correctly upon initial vault access or fresh installations.
  
  Backend & Core Systems
  Various Backend Changes: Significant internal refactoring to support multi-client environments, improve network stability, and streamline the build process for different operating systems.
  Update to version 7.0.
  
  Added a password recovery option on the login screen
  
  Updated backend
  
  Slight internal structure change
  
  Add liquibase for Business structure so that setup is easier.
